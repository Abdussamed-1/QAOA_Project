# QAOA Project - Quantum Optimization for Donor-Recipient Matching

This project implements the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve a bipartite graph maximum cut problem, specifically applied to donor-recipient matching scenarios. The implementation uses Qiskit and IBM Quantum services to run quantum circuits.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on solving an optimization problem where we need to match donors with recipients optimally. The problem is formulated as a bipartite graph where:
- Nodes are divided into two sets: donors and recipients
- Edges represent potential matches with associated weights
- The goal is to find the optimal matching that maximizes the total weight of the cut

## Key Features

- Implementation of QAOA algorithm for quantum optimization
- Support for both local simulation and IBM Quantum backend execution
- Visualization of bipartite graphs and maximum cuts
- Cost function optimization using classical-quantum hybrid approach
- Integration with IBM Quantum services for real quantum hardware execution
